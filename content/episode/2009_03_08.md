Hello and welcome back to Perlcast. After a long break, we are back and are cleaning out the archives and publishing some shows that should have been released long ago. To kick things off, we have brian d foy talking about "Fear and Loathing in Perl" where he takes us through a humorous journey though a day, one where you just can't say no.
