O'Reilly's Source Convention (OSCON) 2007 is happing this week in Portland, Oregon. The conference is in it's first day of sessions, but has really been going on for about five days because of tutorials and the Ubuntu Live conference. As always, this is a great event for catching up with what is going on in the Open Source world and meeting up with people outside of the Perl community.

One of those people that I've talked with is Ross Turk, the Community Relationship Manager at SourceForge.net. Ross sat down for a while with Pete Krawczyk and me and talked about the SourceForge.net system, as well as, the Community Choice Awards 2007 that are scheduled to be handed out tomorrow night. Enjoy the interview.
