After a very long break, Perlcast is back in action. I have quite a few podcasts in the queue, most from the Nordic Perl Workshop 2007. Let's get the first NPW interview out the door with this one with Curtis "Ovid" Poe concerning his work with Perl testing and TAP::Parser.

You can find more information about TAP::Parser at Test Anything and you can also sign up for the mailing list.
