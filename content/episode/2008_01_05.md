Happy New Year and welcome back to Perlcast. Though 2007 ended with a very light lineup of shows, we here at Perlcast are excited about what 2008 has to offer. There are plans for more interviews, more presentations, and possibly even some videos and video tutorials about Perl.

Anyway, let's get back to the podcast. Way back at OSCON 2006, I sat down with Stas Bekman and Philippe M. Chiasson to talk about mod_perl. Though quite a bit of time has passed since the show was recorded, there is still a lot of good mod_perl related information in the show. I hope that you enjoy it.
